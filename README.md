  - #### Colour Scheme
    - The website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to create the colour theme for the website.
    - XX
  - #### Typography

    - The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website and Roboto on the main headings and navigation links, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The text at the homepage banner used "Caveat" font with font "cursive" as a fallback.
